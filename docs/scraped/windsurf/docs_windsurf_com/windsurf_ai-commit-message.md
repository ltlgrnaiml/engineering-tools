Generate git commit messages with a single click. This feature analyzes your code changes and creates meaningful commit messages that describe what you’ve done.
Available with no limits to all paid users!

# ​How It Works

When you’re ready to commit changes:

1. Stage your files in the Git panel
2. Click the sparkle (✨) icon next to the commit message field
3. Review the generated message and edit if needed
4. Complete your commit

The AI analyzes your recent code changes and creates a meaningful commit message that describes what you’ve done.

# ​Best Practices

For better results:

- Apply general best practices for commit scope: group together small, meaningful units of changes
- Review the message before committing

# ​Limitations

- Large or complex commits may result in more generic messages
- Specialized terminology might not always be captured perfectly
- Generated messages are suggestions and may need editing

# ​Privacy

Your code and commit messages remain private. We don’t store your code changes or use them for training our models.
