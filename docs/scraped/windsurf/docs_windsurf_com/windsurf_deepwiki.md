We’ve implemented
[Devin’s DeepWiki feature](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki)
inside of the Windsurf Editor. Use it to get up to speed on unfamiliar parts of your codebase.
You can find the DeepWiki interface in the Primary Side Bar / Activity Bar.
To use DeepWiki, hover over a symbol in your codebase and press
`Cmd+Shift+Click`
to open detailed explanations of code symbols.
Unlike classical hover cards that just show basic type information, DeepWiki-powered hover explains functions, variables, and classes as you read through code.
You can send the DeepWiki explanation to Cascade as an
`@-mention`
by clicking the
`⋮`
button in the top right of the DeepWiki panel and selecting
`Add to Cascade`
.
