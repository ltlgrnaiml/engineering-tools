Vibe and Replace is an evolution of find and replace that allows you to search through your codebase for exact text matches and apply an AI prompt to each replacement.
Use this for more context-aware transformations and refactors.

## ​Modes

Vibe and Replace can be used in two different modes:

1. Smart- utilizes a slower model that will apply changes more carefully
2. Fast- utilizes a faster model that will apply changes quickly

To set the mode, click on the
`⌄`
button next to the Vibe and Replace prompt box.
