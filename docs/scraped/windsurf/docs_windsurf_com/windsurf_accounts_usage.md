Prompt credits are consumed whenever a message is sent to Cascade with a premium model. Every model has it’s own credit multiplier with the default message costing 1 credit. You can view all available models and their associated costs on the
[models page.](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/models)
Prompt credits are issued monthly according to your plan. They do not roll over to the next month—whether or not you’ve used them, your credit balance will reset at the start of each new billing cycle. Once your monthly prompt credits run out, if you have add-on credits, those will automatically be used instead. Unlike prompt credits, add-on credits do not expire and can be carried over until they’re fully used.
Upon using all of your credits, select premium models will no longer be accessible; however, you will still be able to use several other models that we’ve made available for free.

[click here](https://windsurf.com/pricing)
.

## ​Errors

If a user message is unsuccessful, prompt credits will not be consumed. For example, if Cascade attempts to write to a file but that file has unsaved changes, the operation will fail and it will not consume a credit.

## ​Viewing your usage

There are a few ways to view your usage.
Go to the Cascade usage directly by clicking on the overflow menu, and then selecting “Cascade Usage”.
View the settings panel by clicking on “Windsurf Settings” on the status bar, followed by selecting the “Plan Info” tab.
You can also view it on your plan page at
[windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan](https://windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan)
after you’re authenticated.

## ​Upgrading to a paid plan

To learn more about paid features or to upgrade to a paid plan,
[click here](https://windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan)
. Paid plans include Pro for individuals, Teams for organizations, and Enterprise for larger companies.
We accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Cash App Pay, Google Pay, Link, WeChat Pay, and Alipay. If you have a payment method not listed, please reach out to us at
[support](https://windsurf.com/support)
. You may need to disable your VPN to view the relevant payment methods for your region.

## ​What happens when you run out of prompt credits?

If you no longer have prompt credits, you have two options:

- You can purchase additional prompt credits to continue using premium models
- You can use Write or Chat mode with the models that cost 0 credits!

## ​Automatic Credit Refills

We’ve introduced Automatic Credit Refills so that you no longer need to manually purchase additional credits. Under your plan settings page on the Windsurf website, you can specify a maximum amount of credits and other refill settings. The system will automatically “top-up” your credits as you start running low (below 15 credits).
Automatic Credit Refills are purchased in configurable increments (multiples of $10 for Pro and $40 for Teams) and subject to maximum monthly budget caps ($50 by default for Pro users and $160 for Teams users). This ensures you won’t lose access to Cascade during critical work.

## ​Purchasing additional credits

If you run out of prompt credits, you can purchase additional credits in the
[billing website](https://windsurf.com/plan)
. Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of $10 for 250 credits for Pro users.
For Team and Enterprise plans, additional credits are purchased within and treated as a pool amongst all members of the team at a rate of $40 for 1000 pooled credits. Please contact your Teams admin to purchase more credits if you’re on a team plan.

## ​Usage examples

To explain how credits work, here’s a simple example:
When you send a message to Cascade with a premium model, 1 Prompt credit is consumed. It doesn’t matter how many actions Cascade takes to fulfill your request - whether it searches your codebase, analyzes files, or makes edits - you only pay for the initial prompt.
This simplified system makes it much easier to predict and manage your usage. No more complicated calculations of flow actions or different credit types.

## ​Plan Usage

### ​Using a Free Pro Trial

The Pro Trial lasts for 2 weeks and includes unlimited Windsurf Tab, 100 prompt credits, Previews, and Deploys.
When you’re on a Pro Trial, you’ll have access to premium features! To get started, ask Cascade a question. In Write and Chat mode, Cascade is optimized to fully understand your codebase and leverages tool calls to assist you. By default, all of your requests will use premium models until you run out of credits.
After your trial period ends, you’ll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue using premium models.
If you don’t upgrade during the Free Trial period, you’ll be downgraded to our Free plan which includes 25 prompt credits per month.

### ​Using Pro Plan

The Pro plan costs $15/month and includes:

- 500 prompt credits/month
- All premium models
- Previews
- App Deploys

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of $10 for 250 credits.
While on Pro, you’ll have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. You can view how many credits you have remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel that’s accessible in the status bar.
If you’re running low on credits, Cascade will notify you so that you can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. To purchase additional credits, visit the billing website and select “Purchase credits”. The credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.
If you want to reduce your consumption of prompt credits, there are several available models that cost 0 credits!
In addition to prompt credits, Pro comes with unlimited Fast Autocomplete and unlimited premium model requests with Command.

While on the Teams plan, each user will have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. Unlike the previous system, base prompt credits are not pooled - each user has their own credit limit. However, purchased add-on prompt credits are pooled across the organization. You can view how many credits your team has remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel.
If your team is running low on credits, your administrator can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. These add-on prompt credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.
