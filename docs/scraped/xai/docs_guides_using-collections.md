# [Using Collections](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/using-collections#using-collections)

Collections enable you to upload, store, and semantically search through your documents. Whether you're building a RAG application or need to search across large document sets, Collections provides the infrastructure to manage and query your content.

For an overview of what Collections is, please see [Collections](https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/collections).

You can upload a maximum of 100,000 files per collection.

**Looking for Files?** If you want to attach files directly to chat messages for conversation context, see [Files](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/files). Collections are different—they provide persistent document storage with semantic search across many documents.
