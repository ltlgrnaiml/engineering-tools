# [Deferred Chat Completions](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/deferred-chat-completions#deferred-chat-completions)

Deferred Chat Completions are currently available only via REST requests or xAI SDK.

Deferred Chat Completions allow you to create a chat completion, get a `response_id`, and retrieve the response at a later time. The result would be available to be requested exactly once within 24 hours, after which it would be discarded.

Your deferred completion rate limit is the same as your chat completions rate limit. To view your rate limit, please visit [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai).

After sending the request to the xAI API, the chat completion result will be available at `https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id}`. The response body will contain `{'request_id': 'f15c114e-f47d-40ca-8d5c-8c23d656eeb6'}`, and the `request_id` value can be inserted into the `deferred-completion` endpoint path. Then, we send this GET request to retrieve the deferred completion result.

When the completion result is not ready, the request will return `202 Accepted` with an empty response body.

You can access the model's raw thinking trace via the `message.reasoning_content` of the chat completion response.

## [Example](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/deferred-chat-completions#example)

A code example is provided below, where we retry retrieving the result until it has been processed:

```
import os
from datetime import timedelta

from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(api_key=os.getenv('XAI_API_KEY'))

chat = client.chat.create(
    model="grok-4",
    messages=[system("You are Zaphod Beeblebrox.")]
)
chat.append(user("126/3=?"))

# Poll the result every 10 seconds for a maximum of 10 minutes

response = chat.defer(
    timeout=timedelta(minutes=10), interval=timedelta(seconds=10)
)

# Print the result when it is ready

print(response.content)
```

The response body will be the same as what you would expect with non-deferred chat completions:

JSON
