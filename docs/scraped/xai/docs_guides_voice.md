# [Grok Voice Agent API](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#grok-voice-agent-api)

We're introducing a new API for voice interactions with Grok. We're initially launching with the Grok Voice Agent API and will soon be launching dedicated speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs.

## [Grok Voice Agent API](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#grok-voice-agent-api-1)

Build powerful real-time voice applications with the Grok Voice Agent API. Create interactive voice conversations with Grok models via WebSocket for voice assistants, phone agents, and interactive voice applications.

**WebSocket Endpoint:** `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime`

### [Enterprise Ready](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#enterprise-ready)

Optimized for enterprise use cases across Customer Support, Medical, Legal, Finance, Insurance, and more. The Grok Voice Agent API delivers the reliability and precision that regulated industries demand.

### [Low Latency](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#low-latency)

Built for real-time conversations. The Grok Voice Agent API is optimized for minimal response times, enabling natural back-and-forth dialogue without awkward pauses. Stream audio bidirectionally over WebSocket for instant voice-to-voice interactions that feel like talking to a human.

### [Multilingual with Natural Accents](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#multilingual-with-natural-accents)

The Grok Voice Agent API speaks over 100 languages with native-quality accents. The model automatically detects the input language and responds naturally in the same language-no configuration required.

### [Supported Languages](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#supported-languages)

English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Czech, and many more.

Each language features natural pronunciation, appropriate intonation patterns, and culturally-aware speech rhythms. You can also specify a preferred language or accent in your system instructions for consistent multilingual experiences.

### [Tool Calling](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#tool-calling)

Extend your voice agent's capabilities with powerful built-in tools that execute during conversations:

- **Web Search** - Real-time internet search for current information, news, and facts
- **X Search** - Search posts, trends, and discussions from X
- **Collections** - RAG-powered search over your uploaded documents and knowledge bases
- **Custom Functions** - Define your own tools with JSON schemas for booking, lookups, calculations, and more

Tools are called automatically based on conversation context. Your voice agent can search the web, query your documents, and execute custom business logic-all while maintaining a natural conversation flow.

### [Voice Personalities](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#voice-personalities)

Choose from 5 distinct voices, each with unique characteristics suited to different applications:

| Voice | Type | Tone | Description | Sample |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ara** | Female | Warm, friendly | Default voice, balanced and conversational |  |
| **Rex** | Male | Confident, clear | Professional and articulate, ideal for business applications |  |
| **Sal** | Neutral | Smooth, balanced | Versatile voice suitable for various contexts |  |
| **Eve** | Female | Energetic, upbeat | Engaging and enthusiastic, great for interactive experiences |  |
| **Leo** | Male | Authoritative, strong | Decisive and commanding, suitable for instructional content |  |

### [Flexible Audio Formats](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#flexible-audio-formats)

Support for multiple audio formats and sample rates to match your application's requirements:

- **PCM (Linear16)** - High-quality audio with configurable sample rates (8kHz–48kHz)
- **G.711 μ-law** - Optimized for telephony applications
- **G.711 A-law** - Standard for international telephony

### [Example Applications](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/voice#example-applications)

You can use a WebRTC server to connect the client to a server that then connects to the Grok Voice Agent API.

**Architecture:**

Text

```
Browser (React) ←WebRTC→ Backend (Express) ←WebSocket→ xAI API
```

**Features:**

- Real-time audio streaming
- Visual transcript display
- Debug console for development
- WebRTC backend handles all WebSocket connections to xAI API
