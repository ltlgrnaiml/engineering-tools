# [Migrating to New Models](https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/migrating-to-new-models#migrating-to-new-models)

As we release newer, more advanced models, we are focusing resources on supporting customers with these models and will be phasing out older versions.

You will see `deprecated` tag by the deprecated model names on [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai) models page. You should consider moving to a newer model when the model of your choice is being deprecated.

We may transition a `deprecated` model to `obsolete` and discontinue serving the model across our services. An `obsolete` model will be removed from our [Models and Pricing](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models) page as well as from [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai).

## [Moving from an older generation model](https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/migrating-to-new-models#moving-from-an-older-generation-model)

When you move from an older model generation to a newer one, you usually won't need to make significant changes to how you use the API. In your request body, you can switch the `"model"` field from the deprecating model to a current model on [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai) models page.

The newer models are more performant, but you might want to check if your prompts and other parameters can work with the new model and modify if necessary.

## [Moving to the latest endpoints](https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/migrating-to-new-models#moving-to-the-latest-endpoints)

When you are setting up to use new models, it might also be a good idea to ensure you're using the latest endpoints. The latest endpoints have more stable supports for the model functionalities. Endpoints that are marked with `legacy` might not receive any updates that support newer functionalities.

In general, the following endpoints are recommended: - Text and image input and text output: [Chat Completions](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#chat-completions) - `/v1/chat/completions` - Text input and image output: [Image Generations](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#image-generations) - `/v1/image/generations` - Tokenization: [Tokenize Text](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#tokenize-text) - `/v1/tokenize-text`
