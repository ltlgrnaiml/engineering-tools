# [What is Grok?](https://docs.x.ai/docs/introduction#what-is-grok)

Grok is a family of Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by [xAI](https://x.ai).

Inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Grok is a maximally truth-seeking AI that provides insightful, unfiltered truths about the universe.

xAI offers an API for developers to programmatically interact with our Grok [models](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models). The same models power our consumer facing services such as [Grok.com](https://grok.com), the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grok/id6670324846) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.x.grok) apps, as well as [Grok in X experience](https://grok.x.com).

#### Build with  grok-4

To access the  grok-4  models via API, please create an xAI account and an API key.

## [What is the xAI API? How is it different from Grok in other services?](https://docs.x.ai/docs/introduction#what-is-the-xai-api-how-is-it-different-from-grok-in-other-services)

The xAI API is a toolkit for developers to integrate xAI's Grok models into their own applications, the xAI API provides the building blocks to create new AI experiences.

To get started building with the xAI API, please head to [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Grok](https://docs.x.ai/docs/tutorial).
