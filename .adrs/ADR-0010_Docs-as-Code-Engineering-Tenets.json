  "context": "As the codebase and team grow, maintaining high engineering standards, documentation quality, and long-term maintainability becomes increasingly challenging. Inconsistent documentation, lack of enforced standards, and scattered UX messaging can lead to confusion, onboarding friction, and technical debt. A unified docs-as-code approach, enforced by CI and pre-commit, is needed to ensure quality and consistency. This ADR references the legacy ENG-TENETS ADR and the current engineering playbook.",
  "decision_primary": "All engineering standards and documentation are managed as code. MkDocs and mkdocstrings are used for documentation generation. Pre-commit hooks and CI enforce linting, formatting, and Google-style docstrings. The UX message catalog is the single source of truth for user-facing messaging.",
  "decision_details": {
    "approach": "Adopt docs-as-code using MkDocs and mkdocstrings for all documentation. Enforce Google-style docstrings in code. Use pre-commit and CI to check lint/format for both code and docs. UX message catalog is maintained as a versioned, centralized artifact.",
    "constraints": [
      "All documentation must be version-controlled and built with MkDocs.",
      "All public functions/classes require Google-style docstrings.",
      "Pre-commit and CI must block merges on lint/format/doc violations.",
