Ad-hoc or preview-tied checks are unreliable and slow. A standardized, reproducible status model and UX integration are needed to support both quick-path and power-user workflows.",

    "approach": "Implement standardized table probe logic for all tables. Status model is available, partial, missing, empty. Table availability checks are independent from Preview and surfaced in summary panels and UX.",
    "constraints": [
      "Table probe logic must be deterministic and reproducible for the same input.",
      "Status model must be standardized and documented.",
